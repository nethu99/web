            <h3 class="section-title wow fadeInUp">Literature Survey</h3>
            <p class="subheading wow fadeInUp"><span class="highlight">Project Scope</span></p>
<p>Today many people are unable to meet their basic needs due to their low-income status. According to world records, children under the age of 18 make up half of poor people (566 million). The poverty rate among children is 27.7% and among adults, it is 13.4%. But there are also wealthy people in the world. Many wealthy people in society and charitable services find needy people and make donations for various purposes and primarily the government intervenes to reduce poverty. In this way, many different researches have been done around the world regarding the solutions that can be given to eliminate poverty by using technology through donations. </p>

            <p>The issue of impoverished children remains a global concern, with millions suffering significant barriers to receiving critical resources for their well-being and development. While many humanitarian organizations and individuals are ready to assist, coordinating and distributing funds to have maximum impact can be difficult and inefficient. In response to this difficulty, the idea of a platform to coordinate donations for underprivileged children has developed as a possible alternative for streamlining assistance delivery, increasing transparency, and amplifying the collective impact of charity activities.</p>

               <p>This research paper looks at the creation, implementation, and possible impact of such a platform, which acts as a centralized method for managing donations to meet the different needs of vulnerable children. By utilizing technology, community participation, and best practices in humanitarian aid management, the platform aims to bridge the gap between donors and beneficiaries, optimize resource allocation, and empower communities to address the core causes of child poverty and suffering. For this purpose, 4 main applications have been used for the convenience of the users in the web application that we have proposed. There is item categorization, document verification and scoring, clothing matching, and recommendations, trend-based meaningful donations, and feedback analysis. Based on these, our web app is different from other donation apps. For example, A child who needs a dress can choose a dress according to his measurements. In such cases, there is often a lack of proper communication and a lot of fraud and waste. We have used another trick to avoid such things. After logging into this web application, donors can determine what they need this year relative to previous years. It can reduce waste.
               At the heart of this effort is the integration of cutting-edge technology, such as TensorFlow for machine learning (ML) capabilities and natural language processing (NLP), to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the donation coordination process. TensorFlow, a sophisticated open-source machine learning framework, provides extensive capabilities for data analysis, pattern recognition, and predictive modelling, allowing the platform to optimize donation distribution based on changing requirements and priorities. Furthermore, the platform's use of NLP techniques enables it to extract insights from textual data such as donor preferences, recipient profiles, and communication exchanges, allowing for personalized engagement and targeted outreach efforts. By leveraging the power of machine learning and natural language processing, the platform can adapt and change in reaction to changing conditions, ensuring that donations go where they are most needed and have the biggest impact. Furthermore, the web application component of the platform is built with Angular, a popular front-end framework for creating dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
               As the paper builds up, it will conduct a thorough investigation of the platform's design, implementation, and evaluation procedures, drawing on findings from previous research and practical experience. The article uses rigorous analysis and empirical evidence to illustrate the platform's usefulness and scalability, as well as to provide actionable recommendations for policymakers, practitioners, and researchers looking to use technology for social impact.</P>
               
               <P>Finally, this research collaboration aims to add to the expanding body of information on novel approaches to meeting the needs of underprivileged children through coordinated donation efforts. By providing practical insights, evidence-based recommendations, and lessons gained from existing efforts, the paper hopes to assist policymakers, practitioners, and academics working in philanthropy, child welfare, and international development. Finally, the goal is to encourage more collaboration, innovation, and collective action in pursuit of a more equitable and inclusive society for all children.

                  <p>Data Collection and Preparation</p>
                     
               <p>The foundation of the web application involves the collection and preparation of data from various sources. This includes gathering an extensive dataset of images and captions for donated items, medical reports from certified physicians, and user feedback. Images are preprocessed through resizing and normalization, while textual data undergoes tokenization and stopword removal. This ensures that the data is clean and ready for further processing by the machine learning models employed in various components of the application.</p>
                     
                  <p>Multiple Item Classification</p>
                     
               <p>To streamline the donation process, a Multiple Item Classification system is developed using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction. A multi-label classification model is trained with the prepared dataset to categorize donated items into relevant categories such as educational supplies, medical equipment, and clothing. An intuitive user interface is created to allow donors to upload images and descriptions, with the system providing real-time classification to connect items with the specific needs of children. This component ensures efficient allocation and optimizes the impact of donations.</p>
                     
                    <p>Document Verification and Score Rating</p>
                     
                  <p>Ensuring the fair distribution of medical equipment, a rigorous document verification process is instituted. Prospective recipients submit medical reports, which are then reviewed by machine learning models for authenticity, completeness, and diagnostic clarity. A scoring system is implemented based on predefined criteria to prioritize equipment allocation according to the urgency of need. This transparent and accountable system ensures that essential medical equipment reaches those in need promptly and equitably.</p>
                     
                     <p>Clothing Fitting and Recommendation</p>
                     
                     <p>To address the clothing needs of underprivileged children, a clothing fitting and recommendation system is integrated into the application. Recipients capture or upload images using webcam technology, ensuring privacy by not storing visual content. TensorFlow is employed to extract accurate measurements from skeletal structures in the images. These measurements are combined with standardized clothing sizes to generate personalized clothing recommendations. The system facilitates communication between donors and recipients, ensuring that well-fitting clothes are provided, thus improving the quality of life for needy children</p>
                     
                     <p>Trend-Based Meaningful Donations and Feedback Analysis</p>
                     
                     <p>The application incorporates a robust trend-based donation and feedback analysis system to continually improve the donation process. Data from various sources, including user interactions and feedback, is collected and aggregated. TensorFlow is used for trend analysis to identify emerging patterns and essential needs, while NLP techniques are employed to analyze textual feedback from donors and recipients. Insights from this analysis are integrated into the iterative improvement process, ensuring the platform remains responsive to the evolving needs of underprivileged children.</p>
                     
                  <p>System Integration and Continuous Improvement</p>
                     
                  <p>All components of the web application are integrated into a cohesive system that facilitates efficient donation coordination. Regular testing and validation ensure the reliability and effectiveness of each component. Continuous feedback from users is crucial for iterative improvements, allowing the platform to adapt and optimize its processes continually. This methodology ensures that the application not only meets its functional requirements but also maximizes the impact of donations, ultimately supporting the education and well-being of financially challenged children in Sri Lanka.</p>

            <p class="subheading"> <span class="highlight"></span></p>

            <h3>Research Problem</h3>
            <h5 style="color:rgb(14, 15, 15); background-color: antiquewhite)
            ;">The socioeconomic issues faced by Sri Lankan parents in providing good education and needed materials for their children because of the ongoing economic crisis are the research problem addressed by this web application [4].
Due to Sri Lanka's current economic circumstances, many typical families have struggled to provide for the educational demands of their school-age children.  One of the necessities of children in society is clothing, study material, and health supplies for schoolchildren [2].  Because children don't have money to buy them. They depend on their parents, guardians or some children must live with their relatives. This is a societal issue related to wealth disparity. 
Economic challenges in Sri Lanka have resulted in a considerable proportion of parents being unable to finance decent education and meet their children's fundamental requirements. This condition has a negative impact on children's educational development and well-being, perpetuating the cycle of poverty.
Poverty's impact on children's education and overall well-being has been extensively researched and recorded [1], [3]. Poverty, according to research, greatly limits children's access to education, resulting in lower educational attainment, higher dropout rates, and limited opportunities for social and economic advancement. Poverty also exacerbates the challenges faced by children from low-income families.
Also, many things used by school-aged children in wealthy families are thrown away in usable condition and can be donated to another child.  But there are times when it is difficult to find children who need such care, so they abandon this idea and throw away things that are no longer necessary for them, but very valuable to another child. 
This web application intends to address this research problem by offering a platform for parents, guardians, relatives, and children to meet children's educational needs and gain access to necessary things. 
This application connects parents and children with donors who are willing to help and donate educational supplies, clothing, and medical equipment by using technology and the power of philanthropic donations. This web application serves as a matchmaker, connecting appropriate donors with recipients in need and ensuring that donations reach their intended receivers.</h5>

<h3>Solution</h3>
            <h5>the relevant school age, most of the things we use become obsolete.  If they are reusable, you can offer them to another child and assist them. This web application connects and supports donors and organizations in their efforts to satisfy the needs of underprivileged children.  In the same way, we believe that children in poor villages, if they do not have technical equipment, can access this web application through a teacher at their school.  We also hope to introduce a QR code system to easily access this web application and have planned to place it in public places. 
When a donor uploads an image containing multiple items, the system identifies and classifies each item. Donor & recipient segmentation helps personalize the donor experience and improve communication strategies. While registering here, the relevant details should be given to verify the authenticity of the donor & recipient. Additionally, feedback analysis allows the system to gain valuable insights from donor feedback and identify areas for improvement. Handwritten text recognition of documents is processed to verify the legitimacy of documents. (Because in Sri Lanka we mostly use handwritten documents) This authentication system provides an additional layer of security and trust, reducing the risk of fraudulent activity. Also, a point rating system can be used to select the most deserving person to receive the donation & most suitable donors by ranking according to the points of eligibility. Clothing Matching for Body Characteristics to predict the size and fit of clothing items based on individual body measurements with privacy. The system can recommend clothing items that best-fit children.
Also, we intend to include a distribution service in this web application. Information that can link the recipient and the giver is designed to be received through messaging.  After that, if they like, they can call and discuss the relevant information.  Then they can decide to post or courier or meet at home and deliver the goods.  Because some people like to meet and talk with the relevant parties to give support & donate things. Users can directly share donation content on their social media platforms through this web application. And everything records in user profiles.
